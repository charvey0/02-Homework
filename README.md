# Homework #2

### by Cameron Harvey

---

This was a fun project.  I must admit I don't typically enjoy working with CSS, but Bootstrap has really made this more enjoyable for me.

I have learned a couple of things during this activity:
- How to make a grid with Bootstrap
- How to correctly submit a homework assignment (I REALLY hope I did this correctly this time)
- How to make a sticky footer and how to adjust the margins
- How to correctly make the navbar collapse to an icon when the screen is small
- How to use a HTML validation service
- How to include Bootstrap javascript files

Some things I want to know more about:
- How to work with forms
- Bootstrap is a gamechanger already, but I only scratched the surface

## Struggles:

I had a hard time figuring out what to do with the Contact form.  I write a PHP script to process it, but GitHub Pages are static and don't let us use PHP.  Then I did a simple mailto:, but I did not like sending the user to their email program (if it was even set up).  Anyway, I settled on the alert that strongly implies that the message was sent, but in reality it was not.

There is a lot of ways to do this activity and sometimes I was a bit overwhelmed by the wide variety ways of completing the task.
